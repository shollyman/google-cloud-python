class Code(enum.IntEnum):
    """
    The canonical error codes for Google APIs.

    Sometimes multiple error codes may apply. Services should return the
    most specific error code that applies. For example, prefer
    ``OUT_OF_RANGE`` over ``FAILED_PRECONDITION`` if both codes apply.
    Similarly prefer ``NOT_FOUND`` or ``ALREADY_EXISTS`` over
    ``FAILED_PRECONDITION``.

    Attributes:
      OK (int): Not an error; returned on success

      HTTP Mapping: 200 OK
      CANCELLED (int): The operation was cancelled, typically by the caller.

      HTTP Mapping: 499 Client Closed Request
      UNKNOWN (int): Unknown error. For example, this error may be returned when a ``Status``
      value received from another address space belongs to an error space that
      is not known in this address space. Also errors raised by APIs that do
      not return enough error information may be converted to this error.

      HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error
      INVALID_ARGUMENT (int): The client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from
      ``FAILED_PRECONDITION``. ``INVALID_ARGUMENT`` indicates arguments that
      are problematic regardless of the state of the system (e.g., a malformed
      file name).

      HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
      DEADLINE_EXCEEDED (int): The deadline expired before the operation could complete. For operations
      that change the state of the system, this error may be returned
      even if the operation has completed successfully.  For example, a
      successful response from a server could have been delayed long
      enough for the deadline to expire.

      HTTP Mapping: 504 Gateway Timeout
      NOT_FOUND (int): Some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found.

      Note to server developers: if a request is denied for an entire class of
      users, such as gradual feature rollout or undocumented whitelist,
      ``NOT_FOUND`` may be used. If a request is denied for some users within
      a class of users, such as user-based access control,
      ``PERMISSION_DENIED`` must be used.

      HTTP Mapping: 404 Not Found
      ALREADY_EXISTS (int): The entity that a client attempted to create (e.g., file or directory)
      already exists.

      HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
      PERMISSION_DENIED (int): The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation.
      ``PERMISSION_DENIED`` must not be used for rejections caused by
      exhausting some resource (use ``RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`` instead for those
      errors). ``PERMISSION_DENIED`` must not be used if the caller can not be
      identified (use ``UNAUTHENTICATED`` instead for those errors). This
      error code does not imply the request is valid or the requested entity
      exists or satisfies other pre-conditions.

      HTTP Mapping: 403 Forbidden
      UNAUTHENTICATED (int): The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the
      operation.

      HTTP Mapping: 401 Unauthorized
      RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED (int): Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or
      perhaps the entire file system is out of space.

      HTTP Mapping: 429 Too Many Requests
      FAILED_PRECONDITION (int): The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required
      for the operation's execution. For example, the directory to be deleted
      is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc.

      Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between
      ``FAILED_PRECONDITION``, ``ABORTED``, and ``UNAVAILABLE``: (a) Use
      ``UNAVAILABLE`` if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use
      ``ABORTED`` if the client should retry at a higher level (e.g., when a
      client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should
      restart a read-modify-write sequence). (c) Use ``FAILED_PRECONDITION``
      if the client should not retry until the system state has been
      explicitly fixed. E.g., if an "rmdir" fails because the directory is
      non-empty, ``FAILED_PRECONDITION`` should be returned since the client
      should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory.

      HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
      ABORTED (int): The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue such as
      a sequencer check failure or transaction abort.

      See the guidelines above for deciding between ``FAILED_PRECONDITION``,
      ``ABORTED``, and ``UNAVAILABLE``.

      HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
      OUT_OF_RANGE (int): The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or
      reading past end-of-file.

      Unlike ``INVALID_ARGUMENT``, this error indicates a problem that may be
      fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file system
      will generate ``INVALID_ARGUMENT`` if asked to read at an offset that is
      not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate ``OUT_OF_RANGE`` if
      asked to read from an offset past the current file size.

      There is a fair bit of overlap between ``FAILED_PRECONDITION`` and
      ``OUT_OF_RANGE``. We recommend using ``OUT_OF_RANGE`` (the more specific
      error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through a space
      can easily look for an ``OUT_OF_RANGE`` error to detect when they are
      done.

      HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
      UNIMPLEMENTED (int): The operation is not implemented or is not supported/enabled in this
      service.

      HTTP Mapping: 501 Not Implemented
      INTERNAL (int): Internal errors.  This means that some invariants expected by the
      underlying system have been broken.  This error code is reserved
      for serious errors.

      HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error
      UNAVAILABLE (int): The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient
      condition, which can be corrected by retrying with a backoff.

      See the guidelines above for deciding between ``FAILED_PRECONDITION``,
      ``ABORTED``, and ``UNAVAILABLE``.

      HTTP Mapping: 503 Service Unavailable
      DATA_LOSS (int): Unrecoverable data loss or corruption.

          If the queue was created using Cloud Tasks and the queue has had no
          activity (method calls or task dispatches) for 30 days, the queue may

          tasks are not dispatched and ``LeaseTasks`` calls return a
